    Converts <a href="https://piston-meta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest_v2.json">Mojang mappings</a> to a clean JSON format

## What is this

This is a work in progress project I had made a while ago. For now it only parses Mojang mappings into a simpler format, but I plan to add later a system which will resolve the mappings by injecting into Minecraft and then convert it to the required JSON format.

## Usage

Simply execute Mojang2JSON while passing a text Mojang mappings which you can get from their API.
